	<p>Both rounds of user testing were very helpful in discovering some of the issues with my current layout for my application. Some suggestions made were to add a log in screen so users could create a profile or choose to keep their information private.
		Another suggestion was to create a navigation bar that would allow users to click to any section of the application at anytime from any screen.</p>

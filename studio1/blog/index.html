				<p>I wanted to add to my ISEA project for studio 5. The JQuery library I found useful for this help to create and stylize sliders. These sliders can be used to show ranges and make gradual adjustments to the page. I modified the original code to just
					show the 2D sliders and deleted the additional 3D sliders included. I am still working on adding numbers to the range and making the adjustment of the sliders slowly effect background color. When I change one aspect of the Javascript, the sliders
					stop moving for some reason. I am still working on the bugs of this code. These will be used for users to mark on a range the emotion they are feeling. </p>

				<p>I went with a very minimalistic design for this studio in order to build the framework for my ISEA Proposal Project. I think the 3 hover elements and time counter allow for a better interactive experience. Lastly, color choices are vibrant and hovering
					to these bright colors, coupled with the background color, give a vibrant and refreshing presentation to the website. </p>

				<p>I really enjoy dribbble.com's user interface. The design is very clean and straight forward with a clear hierarchy. A user can easily navigate the page and dribbble offers hover features for the dropdown menu at the top and for each post giving a
					detailed description of the design entry. The interface uses primarily grays and white with one pink spot color for the "sign-up" button. This works well to allow the design entries to be the main display of color, attracting the user's interest.
					The interface is very clear and organized, with all information contained clearly to each section.The website appears simple and shows good restraint of design, allowing the user's eye to flow naturally to the work that catches their eye best by
					aesthetic preference. </p>

				<p>Although Uber's website can be overstimulating and a bit busy visually, I really enjoy the simplicity and ease to order a ride. The interface really integrates the look and feel of technology and the iphone with landscapes and map photos to successfully
					present their product in an effective way. The motion and interactivity are particularly appealing.

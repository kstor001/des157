            <p id="tek4">I used to play Tekken 4 with my brother, cousin, and our friends. My brother was always the best at videogames and even though we knew he was always going to beat us we still played.</p>

            <p id="khpara">Kingdom Hearts was the first game I ever bought for the Playstation 2. I remember going to the store with my dad and trying to decide between this game and Final Fantasy X. I am happy I chose to buy this game first.</p>

          <p id="godpara">This was the first game I ever played all the way through. I first watched my brother play through the game before I felt comfortable to play the game alone and feel confident to complete it.</p>

        <section id=disc6>

          <p id="dmcpara">My friend let me borrow this game in middle school. I remember looking up all of the cheat codes online and writing them down on a notebook piece of paper so I could beat the game quicker. </p>

  <p>Quishi's testing of the website was very informative. She recommending changing the font to something more legible, and she mentioned that being an international student, she did not understand the word "Floral" and that I should consider changing to a word that is recognized by a diverse audience. Additionally, she recommended that I include a "click" button to start the page and notify users that they were meant to click. Lastly, she recommended adding additional hover features to the button to improve the experience even further for users. I plan to include Quishi's suggestions into my design to improve clarity for a broader audience.</p>

  <p>Anne's feedback was very helpful in suggesting improvements to content. She recommended including hotline links like the "Suicide Hotline Link"/health counseling for emotions like depression to give people who are feeling intense emotions other options or immediate help. She also suggested including color variety like dark colors to negative emotions. Although I found her advice helpful, I thought creating flower petals that are brown or gray for depression would not help the mood, while using a bright light blue would help people feeling negative emotiond to create a vibrant, beautiful flower. I do plan to include the hotline links and found her input very helpful.</p>

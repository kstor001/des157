    <p>Creating these storyboards was very insightful in helping me figure out some issues with the visuals of the application as well as the goals for what I wanted the application to accomplish. Coming up with authentic scenarios that people would find relatable and not just generic proved to be challenging. I found that the storyboards were helpful in creating a narrative and clearer picture for what I intended my application and what impression I want to leave with users. The storyboards helped me to illustrate possible interfaces and scenarios to help the user tackle moments when they are feeling emotionally overwhelmed. I want the application to have a beautiful interface that will appeal the users and encourage use through interactivity. As I was sketching the ideas I found myself scratching out some frames and adding in others, making me realize I needed to figure out the exact order of events and solidify visual detailed decisions.</p>

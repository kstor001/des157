Commodity Histories is a very informative and influential website for my project. Interestingly, this website acts as an open forum, allowing people to post current commodity findings and give in-depth descriptions from the cultures these commodities originate from. The website allows for people to tell about how their environments and cultures shaped around these commodities and with these commodities.
My second resource, The Natural History of the Raw Materials of Commerce, details the significance of trade and highlights the resources that each culture possessed and which they sought to trade for. This trading of resources was essential for initial interacting between cultures and created drastic change. Of my resources, this book goes the most in depth, laying out what each geographic area had in abundance and what they were in search of. I would love to visualize this information, because I think the topic of natural resources through history is a very interesting perspective, and shows the early complexity of cultures and how they build from their resources to help shape their distinct cultures. I want to give this same impact, but would like to convey the message through visuals on a world map.
My last source, 27 RAW MATERIALS IN THE HISTORY OF ECONOMIC POLICY, addresses the interesting topic that the history of raw materials in economic policy is very informative, but has not been heavily researched.  This article highlights a perspective that pieces together some of the key elements that have led us to where we are currently in history through the development of cultures and their influence by raw materials, trade and how the exchange of these materials further changed the cultures, and how the discovery of coal changed the flow of resources throughout the trading world.

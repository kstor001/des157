		<h2>Feeling Flowers: Hourly Emotion Visualization</h2>

		<img src="../images/sample.png" alt="Example of Interface" style="width:302px; height:401px;" />
		<img src="../images/sketch.png" alt="Sketches for Interface" style="width:400px; height:518px;" />
		<p width: '400px'>
			UPDATE: I changed my topic from natural resource history to a mobile application that allows users to chart their emotions hourly. I would like the application to have a similar aesthetic to the above image example. I like that the example has a vibrant,
			3D, interface. I also like the bright colors and would like to coordinate them to each emotion. Instead of the rigid shapes I would like flower petals to appear for each emotion logged. See "Proposal Draft" tab on main portal page for more information
			and functionality details.
